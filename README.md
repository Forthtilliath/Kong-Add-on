A feature has been added to adjust the brightness of games to make them darker or brighter.

Cinematic mode improved. It adds a dark background and prevents any mouse scrolling while you’re playing to keep your game in the center of the window. No more accidental scrolling while playing!

Chat updated!

To begin, the bots message blocker is able to block some words to not display some message those of bots, if they contain their website link.
Then, a feature to change the text size has been added. You can now reduce or increase the text size. Really useful when you adapt the game to your screen.
You can also enlarge your chat by hiding online players list, or just hide your chat completely if you only want to see your game.
Furthermore, when a player posts a new message in the chat, you will be notified by a ping. You can adjust the volume higher, lower or outright mute it.

By default all quick links like rating, playlist button etc. are hidden to gain some space for new features.

The Kongregate add-on is using cookies to store your preferences.
First cookie is named kong_addon. kong_add is used for the totality of the website. It saves ShowPlayers, FontSize and DarkMode settings.
The second cookie is named kong_addon_game. kong_addon_game is used only on game page, and each game has a different cookie.
