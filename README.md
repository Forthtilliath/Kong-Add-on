## Description
Kong Add-on adds some features to [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/), including a blocker of bot messages, a dark mode, a brighness adjustment, and more.  
Kong add-on will add a button to the top left of your screen for enabling and disabling the dark mode on website. Furthermore, some visual effects have been modified or corrected.

A feature has been added to adjust the brightness of games to make them darker or brighter. You can also choose to only show the game if you don't need the chat.

Cinematic mode improved. It adds a dark background and prevents any mouse scrolling while you’re playing to keep your game in the center of the window. No more accidental scrolling while playing!

Chat updated!

To begin, the bots message blocker is able to block some words to not display some message those of bots, if they contain their website link.  
Then, a feature to change the text size has been added. You can now reduce or increase the text size. Really useful when you adapt the game to your screen.
You can also enlarge your chat by hiding online players list, or just hide your chat completely if you only want to see your game.  
Furthermore, when a player posts a new message in the chat, you will be notified by a ping. You can adjust the volume higher, lower or outright mute it.

By default all quick links like rating, playlist button etc. are hidden to gain some space for new features.

The Kongregate add-on is using cookies to store your preferences. No data is sent to an external server.

First cookie is named **kong_addon**. This one is used for the totality of the website and it saves general settings as the font size, the darkmode or wanting to see other players connected to the chat.

The second cookie is named **kong_addon_game** and is used for only one game page per cookie. It saves game-specific configurations, like wanting or not to block the screen, to have a darker or lighter game, the volume for the sound notifications of the chat for each new message, or even to display only the game, only the cat or both.
